### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a web software developer with two years of experience in languages like Python and Javascript. I also have experience with web technologies like HTML, CSS, Nodejs, React, React Native and database technologies like MySQL or MongoDB  
  
As for education, I am mainly self-taught, so I have the habit of improving my practices every day to be a better developer.  
  
I am passionate about computing and I am super curious, so it is common that I am learning things from different fields, which in principle are not related to computing, allowing me to develop ideas that intersect with knowledge to develop better solutions. I am also very interested in the field of artificial intelligence or machine learning.
